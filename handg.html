          <p>
            Six Fourty by Four Eighty is an interactive light installation that
            changes colour and behaviour according to human touch. A person is
            able to make the panels change colour, pulse, and even transmit their
            colours to other pixels through the human skin. Its aimed to present
            the divital art world like a tangible object. I imagine each person
            would be able to create a unique light pattern that exists as a
            reflection of their interaction with computers, which is what makes
            this so beautiful

          <p>
            The Treachery of Sanctuary is an interactive installation that
            transform viewers silhouettes into an abstract bird-like form that
            takes flight across the screen. They utilise Kinetic sensors and
            cameras to track the movement of participants and translate that
            gestures into a visual representation of birds in flight. I think
            every kid would have at least thought about giving themselves wings
            with cardboard once in their life and try to fly off a platform. This
            installation feels like it would satisfy my innate desire to soar as a
            bird.

          <figcaption>The Silk Website</figcaption>
          <p>
            The Silk Website allows you to create generative silk patterns in a
            mirrored environment. It follows the cursor and forms the illusion of
            silk threads weaved together to form a mesmerising design. I feel like
            I would be on this all day if I was left alone with it. Particularly
            because these effects are also quite hard to recreate using
            traditional methods.

          <figcaption>A 360 Degree Camera Hat</figcaption>
          <p>
            This device allows you to take a full 360 degrees photo using the
            chat, replacing the panoramic setting on phones. This could actually
            be quite useful and brands like GoPro have 360 degree cameras in the
            market already. This shows that Chindogu ideas may sound silly, but
            there can be a real world purpose to it.

          <p>
            This self attach fan flows cool air to the hot noodles, making it the
            perfect temperature to eat without scalding your mouth. This idea is
            so simple but yet I've only realised how useful such a device can be,
            especially now that we are entering winter and start to crave hotter
            foods.

          <figcaption>Playful Odyssey</figcaption>
          <p>
            Playful Odyssey is a VR multisensory puzzel game that uses audio and
            visual designs to immerse player in a synesthetic experience. I think
            the way the visuals change ever so often feels really trippy, sort of
            like its mimicking the feeling of a fever dream.
