      <h1>Workbook Progress</h1>

      <h2>Theme</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to incorporate the same animal / farm theme I had going since
        workbook one, and use 3D elements like I did with workbook two. The
        design will be vibrant, cozy and familiar.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection from workbook two</h2>
      <p>
        My experience with 3D using p5 for workbook two could have been a lot
        better if I was more prepared.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firstly I did not factor in enough time as I didn't realise
          incorporating 3D would take sigificantly longer time
        </li>
        <li>
          There wasn't a tutorial online or code snippet for the idea I had in
          mind
        </li>
        <li>
          I didn't have enough time to experiment much before the deadline
        </li>
        <li>
          There wasn't enough documentation on debugging, which was my biggest
          problem
        </li>
        <li>AI was not helpful</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Goals for workbook three</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to try make an interactive 3D workbook using Three.js and
        reduce my reliance on AI. The goal is to create a scene where the viewer
        can navigate around a scene with iconic tributes to key moments from
        this subject. <br /><br />
        I followed this tutorial by JS Mastery which taught me a few things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Three.js is like a library for WebGL. We can write code for 3D models
          with much fewer lines of code and complication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Three.js is reccomended to use with React because we can use renderers
          to help us (React Three Fiber and React Three Drei)
        </li>
      </ul>

        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
      <p>
        However...I ran into so many problems that I couldn't understand or
        solve. I couldn't even get my model to show up in the scene. At this
        point I felt like I was learning 3 new applications at once, and it was
        <strong>not</strong> going well. This was when I knew I needed to pivot.
      </p>

      <h2>Restarting</h2>
      <p>
        Now that I had a rough overview of Three.js, I wanted to use it as an
        add on to skills I've already learnt. This was when I found Andrew
        Woan's creative development coding course. Andrew Woan teaches us the
        fundamental basics of incorporating 3D into vanilla Javascript using
        Three.js, as well as referencing documentation as we go. This was very
        similar to Matilda and Mei's teaching methods in class where they taught
        us to read the p5 documentation together with the live coding session.

                the button when clicked. The only way to get out is to click on
                the same/or another interactive object</i
              >
              <p>
                These are the few problems that I felt was beyond the scope of
                what I can handle for this submission, so i'll be looking at
                debugging this in the future instead.
