      <h1>Week 7</h1>
      <p>
        This was the first week at the Telstra Creator Space. I've always ever
        only walked by this space before, wondering what it could all be.
        Finally through this subject I get to step foot inside! I've been
        looking forward to entering this space, unsure of what is waiting ahead
        of me, but boy oh boy was I in for an adventure.

      <h2>Introduction to physical computing</h2>
      <p>
        The lecture introduced us to physical technology that serve not only as
        functional devices, but also as artistic pieces ( I now realise how much
        I enjoy watching them) This reminds me of my own interaction with
        physical technology.<br /><br />
        Back when I was on a cruise, there was a robotic bartender where we
        could almost customize our drink order and watch the robot make it
        through its automated process. The drink? Terrible. The entertainment
        value? 10/10. As an ex bartender, that cocktail broke my heart. But
        would I still pay for that <s>$200</s> experience? YES. <br /><br />
        What I liked the most about this experience was feeling like I
        collaborated with this machine to get my drink. Also watching it mimic
        the full human range of motion through its bionic arms really puts into
        perspective how much movement and coordination we go through daily
        without thinking much of.

      <h2>Getting started with Arduino</h2>
      <p>We were split into pairs and given a Arduino kit to disect.</p>
      <img src="./IMG/arduino kit layout.JPG" alt="" class="rotateResizeImg" />
      <p>
        This is my first time seeing and let alone holding a physical computing
        kit. I was completely lost and unsure of what I was even looking at.
        Thankfully the first task, to guess what each part was, was done as pair
        work... it brought comfort knowing my partner was equally as confused.
        But nevertheless we tried our best trying to guess what each piece was
        based on its look and size. Needless to say, we got some horribly wrong,
        but I'm proud to announce we got the battery right... at the very least.

      <h3>Building a push button LED setup</h3>
      <img
        src="/IMG/arduino light setup.JPG"
        alt=""
        width="720"
        height="540"
      />
      <p>
        The first set up was to set up a button that activated the LED when
        pressed. Although now looking back, the idea and execution was simple,
        but in that moment I had no idea what I was looking at and how to follow
        the Tinkercad example.

        Eventually after lots of tinkering and getting help from Matilda and
        Karen, we eventually managed to get it working.

      <h3>Getting Arduino to beep</h3>
      <p>
        After getting a hang of the first set up, this second task did not feel
        as hard. I liked that we got to try out another tool -which looks like
        speakers too! How cute

      <h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        This was a great first introduction to physical computing. The lecture
        session showed us the great capabilities of physical tech and got me
        excited thinking about how I can also start thinking about artistic
        technology within my own practice. <br /><br />
        The hands on session was trickly, challenging but rewarding. Nothing
        beats seeing our LED light up, or sound coming out. However the one
        thing I did find especially challenging was how small the whole set up
        was and how soft it all felt. I had trouble getting the wires in the
        exact hole sometimes and getting that wrong caused my device to not
        work.
