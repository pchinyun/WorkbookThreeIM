      <h1>Week 8</h1>
      <p>
        Over the week I had a look at some of the parts of a Arduino kit I
        wasn't clear about, heres what I learnt: <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>Breadboard</h3>
      <p>
        The big white board with many holes is called the Breadboard The
        Breadboard allows you to connect and test electionic parts without
        soldering (which I had to google: it means to permanently connect
        eletronic parts together with melted metal so electricity can flow
        between them) We can simply plug in wires and components to build
        circuits using the Breadboard.
      </p>

      <h3>Resistors</h3>
      <p>
        Resistors are the small metal wire looking things with coloured stripes.
        Resistors slows down the flow of electricity and its important to
        prevent other parts from getting too much power and burning out. The
        combination colour of the stripes is an indication of its resistance
        power and it varies between brands. What I found troublesome about the
        resistors were sorting them out after using it as it doesnt quite fit
        back into the paper sleeve it came in and its time consuming to cross
        check every combination. But nothing in life is perfect!
      </p>

      <h3>Ground</h3>
      <p>
        The ground is labled as GND and acts like the home base where
        electricity starts and end within a circuit. The reason we need it is
        because electricty needs a complete loop to flow. The flow of
        electricity would go from the power source, thorugh the componenets and
        then back to ground. When we're connecting an LED or sensor, the
        positive side gets connected to the power pin and negative side to the
        GND.
      </p>

      <h2>Potatos makes music too</h2>
      <p>
        This workshop session had us exploring capacitive touch music machines.
        When I think of music, I think of a piano, a guitar or a violin. With
        technology in place, people can now get digital smaller pianos to make
        music. Walking by the class next to ours in Southbank, I often see a
        room full of students using a small digital piano hooked up to a
        computer and headphones. A class of 20 students can play music at the
        same time without disrupting eachother. This capacitive touch device
        must be the V1.0.0.0 of a digital instrument. <br /><br />
        To make this capacitive touch music machine, we followed the Tinkercad
        diagram and set up our boards.

      <p>
        Next we added this code Arduino IDE and connected that to the set up
      </p>
      <div class="codeSnippet">
        <pre><code>
              // Setup pins
              #define PIEZO_PIN 9
              #define LED_PIN 4
              #define csSamples 5
              
              // Create CapacitiveSensor objects
              CapacitiveSensor cs_2_3 = CapacitiveSensor(2, 3); // Wire 1
              CapacitiveSensor cs_2_5 = CapacitiveSensor(2, 5); // Wire 2
              CapacitiveSensor cs_2_6 = CapacitiveSensor(2, 6); // Wire 3 (NEW)
              
              bool lampState = false;  // (optional LED stuff)
              
              int sen1Val, sen2Val, sen3Val = 0;
              
              void setup() {
                Serial.begin(9600);
                
                pinMode(PIEZO_PIN, OUTPUT);
                pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
                
                Serial.println("Setup complete. Ready for touch!");
              }
              
              void loop() {
                // Read sensor values
                sen1Val = cs_2_3.capacitiveSensor(csSamples);
                sen2Val = cs_2_5.capacitiveSensor(csSamples);
                sen3Val = cs_2_6.capacitiveSensor(csSamples);
              
                // Debugging: print all sensor values
                Serial.print("Sen1: "); Serial.print(sen1Val);
                Serial.print(" | Sen2: "); Serial.print(sen2Val);
                Serial.print(" | Sen3: "); Serial.println(sen3Val);
              
                // Tone logic based on touch
                if (sen1Val > 50) {  // Adjust threshold as needed
                  tone(PIEZO_PIN, 262, 200); // C4 (Middle C) - 262 Hz
                  Serial.println("Wire 1 touched - C4");
                }
                else if (sen2Val > 50) {
                  tone(PIEZO_PIN, 294, 200); // D4 - 294 Hz
                  Serial.println("Wire 2 touched - D4");
                }
                else if (sen3Val > 50) {
                  tone(PIEZO_PIN, 330, 200); // E4 - 330 Hz
                  Serial.println("Wire 3 touched - E4");
                }
                else {
                  noTone(PIEZO_PIN); // No touch = no sound
                }
              
                delay(100); 
              }
        </code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        And the result was different sounds emitting when you pressed on the
        wires!
      </p>
      <div class="video">
        <video
          src="./IMG/arduino music.MOV"
          class="vid rotateResizeImg"
        ></video>
        <div class="videoBtn">
          <button class="vidBtn">Play</button>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Next we poke the wires through different objects. Our neighbours used
        leafs, grapes, carrots. We picked potatos. The result was so cool: we
        could play music by pressing onto the potatos! We even tried to play
        familiar tunes but there wasnt enough notes for it, still fun though!
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        This potato set up reminds me of potato batteries. I was too young to
        understand the science behind it then, (not that I understand the
        science behind it now either) but I see how potatos are great conductors
        of electricity.

      <h2>Chindogu</h2>
      <p>
        Chindōgu (珍道具) refers to the Japanese art of inventing ingenious but
        ultimately impractical or useless everyday gadgets. These inventions are
        often humorous and serve as a form of art, rather than practical
        solutions to problems. They represent freedom of thought and action,
        challenging the idea that everything must have an economic value.
        <br /><br />
        I went down a spiral scrolling through endless Chindōgu designs.
        <br /><br />
        Heres my take on Chindōgu
      </p>

      <h3>Anti Right Handed Device</h3>
      <p>
        As a leftie, we all know the struggles of living in a right handed
        world. What if I could create something that inconvenience right
        handers. My Anti Right Handed Device attaches itself to a pencil, with
        an eraser on the other hand. As a right hander writes, the eraser erases
        whatever they wrote, deeming their words useless.
      </p>
      <img src="./IMG/anti right device.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" />

      <h3>Pro Left Handed Device</h3>
      <p>
        On the other hand, what if I could flip this device around, making it a
        device <i>specifically made for</i> left handers. The Pro Left Handed
        Device erases everything written in their way, allowing their words to
        fill the space instead.
      </p>

      <h3>Anti Fog Glasses</h3>
      <p>
        Usually when eating noodles or sipping something hot, I would take off
        my glasses because of the steam fogging my glasses. This made me think
        what if I could attach a windshield wiper to my glasses so I can still
        keep them on as I eat. It could be quite practical but such a silly
        thing to look at. But who knows? We could be all counting on Zendaya to
        make this a trend.
