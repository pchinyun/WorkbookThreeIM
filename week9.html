      <h1>Week 9</h1>
      <p>
        This week we learnt how to connect our Arduino setup with P5js, super
        useful for the final project

        <p>
          Instead of working as a pair or group like other weeks, this was an
          individual activity. I realised there were still many things I wasn't
          sure about. This device might be small but there sure were a lot of
          parts to it. I realised the difficulty of physical computing was not
          only having to debug the code, but also making sure the physical setup
          was done right.
          <br /><br />
          When my setup was not working, I didn't know if it was because my code
          was wrong, I downloaded the wrong library, my wires were connected in
          the wrong holes, my kit wasn't working, my laptop doesn't want to be
          productive, or that I was just having a bad day. This makes me admire
          physical computing projects even more, knowing they probably face this a
          1000 more times while working on their prototypes.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Ideating final project ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Through the past 8 weeks of Interactive media I realised that I am
          interested in creative coding, so I wanted to do a final project
          centered around that. Here are some of my ideas:
        </p>
  
        <h3>Audio controlled game</h3>
        <img
          src="./IMG/audio controlled game.jpg"
          alt=""
          width="720"
          height="540"
        />
        <p>
          The idea behind this is a game that uses voice control to move a
          character through the maze. I wanted to utilise the voice to text
          function in P5js. The player has to say "left" or "right", and when the
          program senses these word, it makes the character move. <br /><br />
          However after the in class consultation, I realise I have some
          reservations about using this as my final project as I was merely
          interested in further developing voice to text, but not quite as engaged
          with developing the game itself. I will consider keeping the audio
          technology, but refine the concept.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Escape Room</h3>
        <img src="./IMG/escape room.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" />
        <p>
          To me personally, interactive media is exciting when it evokes some
          emotion in me. Escape rooms comes to mind when I think of immersive
          experience. I wanted to recreate that into a digital form, possibily by
          creating a 3D scene filled with planes filled with riddles and puzzles.
          To evoke a sense of thrill, I thought of using a creepy game host that
          lurks around the corner and urges the player to get out of the room as
          fast as possible.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Social garden</h3>
        <img src="./IMG/voices that bloom.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" />
        <p>
          While both audio controlled game and escape room ideas were enticing as
          final project ideas, I just felt something was missing. This was when I
          started scrolling IG and there I saw the announcement:<strong>
            The Lume is closing.
          </strong>
  
          Then it hit me, another idea that allows me to piece all my previous
          ideas together with a greater purpose. <strong>Social Garden</strong>
          <i>Now renamed to Voices that Bloom.</i> <br /><br />
          Voices that Bloom is a chill, interactive digital space where peopleâ€™s
          voices bring the environment to life. The idea is simple: when people
          talk, laugh, or just make noise together, flowers start to grow and fill
          the space. The louder the group gets, the more vibrant and full the room
          becomes. If it goes quiet, everything fades back into emptiness. Itâ€™s
          meant to show how beautiful connection and social interaction can be â€”
          especially in a group. Whether itâ€™s a group of friends yelling just to
          see what happens, or people naturally chatting and hanging out, the
          space becomes a reflection of that energy. Itâ€™s also kind of playful â€”
          encouraging people to be loud, expressive, and maybe even meet new
          people.
          <br /><br />
          This combines audio technology with an immersive experience to evoke a
          sense of peace and joy as people watch flowers bloom to their voices.
